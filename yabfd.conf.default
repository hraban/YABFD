# enough information (as is the case with syslog.. blegh). This line of
# python code is executed after parsing the date (date is the name of
# the variable, a datetime.date() object). You can use it to tailor the
# date to your needs. The datetime and time modules are imported.
# This example sets the year to the current year.
