There are some bugs in YABFD that you should be aware of if you want to
use it:

* Locking: The program does not check whether another yabfd process is
  already running. Whether or not this is YABFD's responsibility at all
  is debatable. Regardless, before setting up a cronjob to run this
  program every x minutes, make sure that it does not start if another
  instance is still running. This will create a cascade of processes
  that will eventually clog up your system (best-case: no more
  brute-force detection, worst-case: DOS).
* Integrity: The code base is rarely tested. The little testing that
  does take place is just some manual see-if-it-works, no unit-tests, no
  QA whatsoever. Beware!
* Syslog: Parsing (default) syslog logs is a drag, mainly because of the
  year-issue. Syslog does not log in which year an event takes place, so
  it needs to be hacked around. See the configuration file for more
  info.
